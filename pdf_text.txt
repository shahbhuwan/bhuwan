Poster / Project Summary  
In Fall 2024, I presented a research poster examining sediment deli very from agricultural 
hillslopes with vegetative buffers using the WEPP model , focusing on the Upper Duck 
Creek watershed near Davenport, Iowa (92.75 km²) . The study simulated 21 years of climate 
data (2000 –2020) across representative hillslopes with vari ed slopes derived from a 30 m DEM 
and conventional corn –soybean management.  
The modeling results demonstrated that wider buffers are generally more effective at 
reducing sediment delivery , with a standard 30-ft buffer achieving approximately 60% 
sediment r eduction , and diminishing returns observed beyond this width. Grass buffers were 
found to be the most effective overall, though no statistically significant differences were 
observed among vegetative buffer types. The analysis further showed that hillslope  shape plays a 
critical role, with concave slopes reducing erosive energy and convex slopes increasing it.  
This work highlighted the capability of WEPP to simulate erosion and sediment transport at 
HUC -12 scales , providing actionable insights for targeting  Best Management Practices (BMPs) 
and informing cost -effective conservation planning. The poster strengthened my experience in 
integrating modeling, spatial data, and scientific communication to address real -world soil and 
water conservation challenges.

AWM applications by enabling simulations under projected climate conditions, impr oving the 
tool’s relevance for long -term nutrient management and conservation planning.

In parallel, I secured two major competitive awards. The WRC Graduate Student Grant  
supported the development of high -resolution, bias -corrected climate projections for  Iowa 
watersheds, validated using Mesonet and ASOS observations and designed for integration with 
WEPP and other hydrologic models . The IPCC Scholarship Programme award  funded the 
development of a novel hybrid stochastic –machine learning framework to down scale CMIP6 
climate data to 1-minute temporal resolution , with applications in both the Colorado Rockies 
and Nepal Himalayas.  
Together, these efforts advanced my dissertation research by establishing scalable, high -

In Fall 2025, I presented a framework that integrates high -resolution climate projections into 
watershed modeling to assess how erosion and water quality risks may evolve under future 
climate conditions. Using Upper Duck Creek as a testbed , I evaluated whether conservation 
practices such as contouring and vegetative buffers can reduce increased erosion risks under
